# Demo Video Script (~ 2 minutes)

A tight, narration-led walkthrough of the BLACKTHORN extension catching a
malicious transaction at the wallet layer. Recorded on devnet against the
local server + showcase.

---

## Setup before recording

```bash
# Terminal 1
pnpm dev:server                 # :8080

# Terminal 2
pnpm build:extension            # produces dist/

# Load the extension in Chrome (one-time)
#   chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked → apps/extension/dist/

# Terminal 3
pnpm dev:showcase               # :5174
```

Have ready in tabs:
1. The wallet's options page (`chrome-extension://<id>/src/options/index.html`) showing onboarding done + Balanced policy applied
2. `http://localhost:5174` — the showcase home

Reset BLACKTHORN's history before recording so the Activity tab is clean
("Reset wallet" then re-onboard, or just clear `chrome.storage.local`).

## Storyboard

### 0:00 — 0:15 · Hook

**Camera:** Phantom approval modal still frame (or any wallet's "Confirm
transaction" screen with raw program IDs). Voice-over over a quick fade-in.

> "This is what every Solana wallet shows you before you sign. A program ID,
> an account list, a Confirm button. You're trusting the dApp to be honest.
> Nine times out of ten it is. The tenth time, you lose your wallet."

### 0:15 — 0:30 · The wedge

**Camera:** Cut to BLACKTHORN's options home — the smart wallet hero balance
+ active policy summary + Authority key card.

> "BLACKTHORN is a Solana wallet built on the open-source Swig protocol,
> with three layers nothing else has: pre-flight simulation, a stateful
> grants ledger, and a live monitor that watches what happens after you
> sign. Devnet today, mainnet ready when you are."

### 0:30 — 0:55 · The benign sign

**Camera:** Showcase site. Click "SolSwap." Click "Connect Wallet." Modal
shows BLACKTHORN — Recommended. Click it.

> "Wallet Standard discovery — any dApp picks BLACKTHORN up the moment
> you install."

The extension popup connect flow runs silently. Site shows green dot +
authority address.

Now click "Swap" with the danger toggle off.

> "Normal swap. The wallet builds the transaction, simulates it on-chain,
> runs it past my Balanced policy. Two seconds."

Popup re-renders into the sign-request surface. Show the green hero +
"What changes" rows + zero findings.

> "Safe to sign. Sign and send."

Click Sign. Returns to showcase with "Transaction confirmed."

### 0:55 — 1:30 · The malicious sign

**Camera:** Toggle "Simulate malicious swap" on. Click Swap again.

Popup re-renders. This time the hero is **red**: Blocked by your policy.

Pause on the findings list. Read one out loud:

> "BLACKTHORN sees the transaction routes through an unverified program
> with a 92 % loss to a wallet I've never seen. The dApp's price preview
> said 137 USDC. The actual transfer is a drain."

Highlight the disabled "Sign anyway" button (red, danger styling).

> "There's no way to fat-finger past this. The button's disabled. Not
> because the dApp asked nicely — because my own wallet refused."

Click Decline. Return to showcase. The red overlay says "Blocked at the
wallet."

### 1:30 — 1:50 · The grant ledger + monitor

**Camera:** Cut to the wallet popup — Activity tab.

> "Every signature, every block, every drift attempt is in here. Including
> the ones I declined. Filterable, exportable, with the BLACKTHORN verdict
> attached."

Switch to the Allowances tab.

> "And every grant I've ever issued — token approvals, x402 spending caps,
> per-merchant scopes — has a row here with a live progress bar. One tap to
> pause. One tap to revoke."

(If you have a fake x402 paywall set up: trigger it once to generate a
realistic allowance row with rolling caps.)

### 1:50 — 2:00 · Close

**Camera:** Back to the wallet's options home. Pull-back shot.

> "Solana doesn't have a wallet that does this. We built one. The protocol
> is open source. The spec, the simulation engine, the policy DSL — all on
> GitHub. Try it on devnet. Bring your dApp."

End card: BLACKTHORN logo + GitHub URL.

## Lower-thirds / on-screen text

Tap these as they appear in the narration:

- *"Pre-flight sim · Stateful ledger · Live monitor"* (during 0:15)
- *"Wallet Standard auto-discovery"* (0:30)
- *"Same dApp. Same Connect button. Different outcome."* (0:55)
- *"BLACKTHORN refused at the wallet — not the page."* (1:25)
- *"Devnet · Open source · github.com/Aeztrest/BLACKTHORN"* (2:00)

---

## Fallbacks

- **Devnet airdrop fails on first take?** Pre-fund the demo wallet from
  faucet.solana.com before recording so the onboarding step is instant.
- **No x402 paywall to demo?** Skip the Allowances live-cap segment; the
  Activity feed alone is enough to show the ledger story.
- **Audio length?** The script clocks ~140 spoken seconds. If it runs over
  120, drop the "live cap" segment first; the malicious-sign block is the
  load-bearing demo.

## Cuts that didn't make it (optional ~3-min version)

- Onboarding wizard timelapse (1× to 4× speed): pass the 8 steps in 20 s.
- Options page scrub: sidebar reveal + Policies tab side-by-side raw JSON.
- Drift alert demo: manually broadcast a tx as the authority via CLI;
  background monitor catches it; popup badges +1; click reveals the
  incident card.

These extend to ~3 min and turn the demo into a feature tour. Use the
2-min version for submission.
